# Third-party notices

This repository does not vendor third-party skill content (FR-10.5): every
skill under `.claude/skills/` that isn't first-party is a symlink into a git
submodule, or generated locally from the developer's own Xcode install —
see [`.claude/skills/README.md`](.claude/skills/README.md) for the mechanism
and provenance table. Nothing there is redistributed by this repository's
own git history. This file exists because MIT still requires its copyright
notice to travel with anyone who ends up with a copy of the code — including
a submodule checkout most contributors won't open by hand.

Source: [dpearson2699/swift-ios-skills](https://github.com/dpearson2699/swift-ios-skills),

vendored, so cloning this repository with submodules fetches that upstream
repository directly, under its own license.

a Claude Code skills collection, so this applies without restriction here.

## `swiftui-specialist`, `swiftui-whats-new-27`

Source: Apple, generated locally on each developer's own machine by
`.claude/hooks/apple-skills-export.sh` running `xcrun agent skills export`
against their own licensed Xcode 27 install. These directories are
gitignored and never enter this repository's git history — the previous
version of this project vendored a point-in-time copy of Apple's export
output, which was a redistribution-rights question with no clear answer;
switching to generating it fresh, locally, from tooling every contributor
building this project already has removes the question rather than
answering it. There is nothing to attribute here because nothing from Apple
is ever committed.
