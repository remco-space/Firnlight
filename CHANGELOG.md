# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to the versioning scheme in REQUIREMENTS.md FR-8.9
(`major.minor.patch`, held at `0.x.y` until the app's first real release).

Entries are added to `Unreleased` as part of the change that prompts them —
not written retroactively from git history — and moved under a version
heading when that version is released (FR-10.3).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Lowered the supported platforms to macOS 26+ and iOS 26+ (was 27+), so the
  app runs on the currently released system rather than only pre-release
  seeds. Release builds now come from GitHub Actions on the matching
  `macos-26` runner image instead of a local machine, so what ships is
  built against the same SDK generation it targets.
